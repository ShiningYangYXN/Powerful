# Powerful, the best library for console apps
## Introduction
Tired of using `ANSI Escape Sequences` in your project? Here is *all* you need to create wonderful console apps with ANSI colors and other amazing things --- **in human-readable syntax**! This project is made for humans **(and of course, with love)**, so you won't see the anti-human syntax of ANSI Escape Sequences anymore. **You can use the library like talking**. We also provide spinners, progressbars, messages and other controls in console apps.
